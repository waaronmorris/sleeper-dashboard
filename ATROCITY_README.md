## 🧮 The Formula

```javascript
Atrocity Score = Base Score × Position Factor × Context Multiplier

Base Score =
  (Ranking Gap × 0.15) +
  (Start % Gap × 0.20) +
  (Projection Gap × 0.25) +
  (Actual Points Gap × 0.40)
  + Status Bonus

Scale: 0-100 points
```

### Component Weights Rationale

**Actual Points Gap (40%)** - Highest weight
- What you actually experience
- The pain of leaving points on bench
- Most objective outcome measure

**Projection Gap (25%)** - High weight
- Shows if you ignored pre-game info
- Forward-looking metric
- Combines matchup/volume data

**Start Percentage Gap (20%)** - Medium weight
- Crowd wisdom from thousands of managers
- Implicitly captures injuries, matchups
- Shows conviction level

**Ranking Gap (15%)** - Lower weight
- Expert consensus aggregation
- More volatile week-to-week
- Less predictive than projections

### Status Bonuses (Flat Additions)
- OUT/IR/Suspended: +40 points (automatic Level 3+)
- Doubtful: +20 points
- Questionable: +5 points

### Position Factors
- QB: 0.85 (most consistent)
- RB: 1.15 (high variance)
- WR: 1.20 (highest variance)
- TE: 1.10 (medium variance)
- K: 0.90 (consistent)

### Context Multipliers
- Weeks 1-6: 0.5x (learning period)
- Weeks 7-13: 1.0x (standard)
- Weeks 14+: 2.0x (playoffs)
- Championship: Additional 1.5x
- Late news (<1hr): 0.5x
- Late news (1-4hr): 0.7x

## 🎨 Customization

### Adjust Weights
Edit `src/components/helpers.js`:

```javascript
const baseScore = (
  components.rankingGap * 0.15 +      // Adjust this
  components.startPctGap * 0.20 +     // Adjust this
  components.projectionGap * 0.25 +   // Adjust this
  components.actualGap * 0.40         // Adjust this
) * 100;
```

### Modify Severity Thresholds
Edit `categorizeSeverity()` function:

```javascript
if (score < 20) return { level: 1, label: 'Questionable', ... };
// Adjust thresholds as desired
```

### Add Custom Badges
Edit `getAllBadges()` function:

```javascript
custom_badge: {
  name: 'Custom Badge',
  desc: 'Your description',
  emoji: '🎯',
  level: 3
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. **Data Loader** (`atrocities.json.js`)
   - Fetches Sleeper API data
   - Analyzes lineups
   - Calculates scores
   - Outputs JSON

2. **Dashboard Page** (`atrocity.md`)
   - Loads JSON data
   - Creates visualizations with Observable Plot
   - Renders interactive components

3. **Helper Functions** (`helpers.js`)
   - Reusable calculation logic
   - Shared across data loader and dashboard
   - Enables future enhancements

### Observable Framework Integration
- Uses FileAttachment for data loading
- D3.js for data manipulation
- Observable Plot for charts
- Observable Inputs for controls
- Reactive JavaScript for interactivity

### Performance
- Data cached during development
- Calculations run once per build
- Efficient data structures (rollups, maps)
- Lazy loading of visualizations

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current Implementation
1. **Bench Points Tracking:** Current implementation uses simplified approach. Ideally would track actual bench player points from game stats.

2. **Start Percentages:** Requires external data source (FantasyPros API, ESPN, etc.). Currently using placeholder values (50%).

3. **Projections:** Would benefit from real pre-game projections. Currently using position averages as estimates.

4. **Historical Context:** Doesn't yet track lineup changes throughout week (useful for "Tinkerer" badge).

### Future Enhancements
1. **Integrate FantasyPros API** for rankings and start percentages
2. **Add projection data source** (Sleeper has some projections)
3. **Track bench player actual points** from game stats
4. **Add lineup change tracking** for enhanced badges
5. **Implement ML weight optimization** based on win correlation
6. **Add "What If" simulator** showing optimal lineups
7. **Create weekly email digest** of atrocities
8. **Add social sharing** of worst decisions

**Remember:** The Atrocity Score measures lineup decisions, not your worth as a human being. Everyone makes atrocious decisions sometimes. The key is learning from them... and laughing about them later. 😄

*"Sometimes the best strategy is having no strategy at all."*
