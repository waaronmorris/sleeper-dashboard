  "summary": "*Adjusts tie, signature SVP smirk*\n\nLadies and gentlemen, Week 6 brought us everything from nail-biters to absolute boat races, and I'm here for all of it. Let's start with mjgrana dropping a cool 149.84 points on cosmohouck in what can only be described as fantasy football poetry in motion. When you're putting up numbers like that, you're not just winning - you're making a statement. And cosmohouck's 132.08 would've won almost any other matchup this week, but sometimes you just run into a buzzsaw.\n\nSpeaking of running into things, tr4sh might want to consider a rebrand after putting up 42.7 points against drobs' 90.38. That's the kind of score that makes you want to delete your fantasy app and take up knitting. And how about mastab24 squeaking by PrinceofPizza by just 2.52 points? That's the kind of margin that keeps you up at night, counting sheep and questioning every lineup decision you've ever made.\n\n*Leans back in chair* \n\nAnd speaking of questionable decisions, our friends Langland and PrinceofPizza might want to consider hiring a fantasy consultant after leaving enough points on their bench to fill a small stadium. Look, we've all been there - that moment on Sunday night when you realize the guy you benched just had the game of his life. But leaving 14 points on the bench? That's the kind of thing that gets you uninvited from the league barbecue. As we like to say here at the midnight hour: Sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug. This week, some of our managers were definitely feeling a bit... insect-like.",
