  "summary": "Oh baby, what a week we just witnessed in fantasy football, folks! Like Matthew Perry's Chandler Bing would say, \"Could these scores BE any more dramatic?\" Let me tell you, we saw everything from absolute dominance to the kind of performance that makes you want to check if your lineup accidentally auto-drafted from a 2015 cheat sheet.\n\nThe headline of the week has to be cosmohouck delivering a knockout blow that would make Mike Tyson blush, putting up a league-high 148.74 points while Langland... well, Langland pulled what I like to call a \"Game of Thrones Season 8\" - started with such promise but ended with a disappointing 45 points. That 103.74-point margin of victory is the kind of thing that makes you want to check if Mercury is in retrograde or if someone accidentally enabled \"God Mode\" in the settings.\n\nAnd can we talk about lineup decisions for a moment? PrinceofPizza left enough points on their bench to cater an actual pizza party, with over 46 combined points sitting there collecting virtual dust. It's like having Tom Cruise in your movie but keeping him in the background as an extra - you just don't do that! Meanwhile, Seananigans squeaked by TophTT in what turned out to be our closest matchup of the week at 14.06 points, though in this week's scoring landscape, that's practically a photo finish. Speaking of finishes, that's what we call a wrap on Week 2, folks - where the only thing more unpredictable than the scoring was the managers' lineup decisions. Back to you in the studio!",
