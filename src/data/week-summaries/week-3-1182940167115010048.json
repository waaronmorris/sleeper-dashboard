  "summary": "WHAT IS GOIN' ON BOYS AND GIRLS?! We just witnessed another ABSOLUTE BANGER of a fantasy week and I am JACKED UP to break it down for you! \n\nHOLY SMOKES, we gotta start with drobs putting up a MONSTER 138.48 points - that's what we call ABSOLUTELY DOMINANT! But the real story this week? Langland putting up possibly the most HORRIFIC fantasy performance I've ever seen with 12.14 points! TWELVE POINT FOURTEEN! That's not a fantasy score, that's a bowling score! Powerperson absolutely DEMOLISHED them by 93 points, which is the kind of beating that makes you want to delete your fantasy app and move to a remote island!\n\nAnd how about my guy PrinceofPizza making lineup decisions like he's throwing darts blindfolded?! LEFT ALMOST 45 POINTS ON THE BENCH! That's like ordering a pizza and leaving it in the box for three days - YOU JUST CAN'T DO THAT! And speaking of performances that'll keep you up at night, mastab24 absolutely WALLOPED tr4sh with a 56-point victory that had to hurt! \n\nWhat's WILD is we didn't have a single close game this week - the tightest margin was mjgrana beating Seananigans by 21 points, which in any other week would be a BLOWOUT! The fantasy gods were feeling SPICY this week and I am HERE FOR IT! That's the kind of week that makes fantasy football the greatest game on Earth, and if you disagree with me, YOU'RE WRONG!",
