  "summary": "BOO-YAH! Week 1 is in the books, y'all, and let me tell you - some managers came out cooler than the other side of the pillow, while others looked like they were trying to dance salsa to a reggae beat. The game of the week? Shogunation and tr4sh went toe-to-toe like Ali-Frazier, with tr4sh squeaking out a victory by just 1.28 points. That's tighter than MC Hammer's pants in '91!\n\nSpeaking of things getting ugly, cosmohouck laid the smackdown on powerperson like it was Monday Night Raw, winning by nearly 68 points! That wasn't a fantasy matchup, that was a fantasy massacre! PrinceofPizza also came through with some extra toppings, serving up a 34-point victory over Seananigans that had more sauce than a Bad Boy Records compilation.\n\nBut y'all, we gotta talk about these lineup decisions that were shakier than a caffeinated chihuahua. TophTT might've gotten the W, but leaving 30 points on the bench? C'mon son! That's like having Beyonc√© in your contacts but calling up the karaoke bar instead! And powerperson, leaving 27 points on the bench is like ordering a filet mignon and eating the napkin - you just can't do that! But hey, that's why we love this game, because just like my man Jay-Z said, \"On to the next one!\" Week 2, we coming for you!",
