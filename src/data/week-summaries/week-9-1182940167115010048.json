  "summary": "Well, well, well. You know that feeling when you check your fantasy app Sunday night and something feels... off? Like when you're pretty sure you paid your cable bill but the screen's gone dark anyway? That's what happened to everyone in this league, my friends. We've got six matchups, twelve teams, and a combined scoring total that matches my vertical leap: a clean, crisp, impossibly perfect zero. Not a single point scored. Anywhere. It's like everyone collectively decided to take the week off, go to Cabo, and leave their lineups on auto-pilot. Except auto-pilot crashed into a mountain.\n\nNow let's talk about these \"victories\" - and I'm using air quotes so aggressively I might pull a muscle. PrinceofPizza beats drobs by 0.00. Seananigans - fantastic name, by the way - takes down Langland by the exact same margin of absolutely nothing. We've got powerperson over Shogunation, cosmohouck edging tr4sh, Tishathefish swimming past mjgrana, and TophTT somehow defeating mastab24. All by goose eggs. The league gave us six games decided by under ten points - technically true since zero is less than ten - but let's call this what it really is: a Bad Beat for literally everyone involved, winners included.\n\nHere's where it gets spicy though. We need to talk about \"The Prince of Nothing\" taking on drobs in what I'm now calling the beginning of the Frozen Tundra Rivalry. Because that's what this is, folks - two teams so evenly matched, so perfectly balanced in their complete inability to score, that they deserve their own 30 for 30. \"What if I told you... that sometimes winning means showing up and doing absolutely nothing?\" Meanwhile, \"Donut King\" mastab24 and TophTT are locked in their own battle for futility supremacy, and I've got bad news: they're both undefeated at stinking it up this week.\n\nLook, I've seen some rough beats on this show. The guy who lost because of that stat correction at 2 AM. The manager who started three players on bye. But this? This is performance art. This is twelve people simultaneously forgetting that Week 9 of the NFL season actually happened. So here's to everyone involved - you didn't leave points on the bench, you left your entire lineups in some parallel universe where football doesn't exist. That's not just a Bad Beat, folks. That's a crime scene. And with that... we'll say goodnight from Bristol.",
