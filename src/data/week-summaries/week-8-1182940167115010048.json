  "summary": "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the weirdest week of fantasy football I've ever had the pleasure of narrating. And I've seen some strange ones in my day. Week 8 brought us something truly special - or should I say, absolutely nothing at all. That's right, folks, we're looking at all zeros across the board. It's like everyone decided to take a collective fantasy sabbatical.\n\nNow, you want to talk about Bad Beats? Every single matchup was decided by exactly zero points. That's either the most fair or the most cruel thing I've ever seen in fantasy sports. We've got Seananigans and drobs locked in what I can only describe as the most intense staring contest in fantasy history. Both teams put up goose eggs, and Seananigans somehow came away with the W. I've seen some low-scoring affairs in my time, but this takes \"defensive battle\" to a whole new level.\n\nThe rivalry between PrinceofPizza and Langland has been heating up all season, and this week they decided to really dial it back - way back - to absolute zero. It's like watching two master chess players agree to leave all their pieces in the starting position. And speaking of Bad Beats, imagine being tr4sh, putting up zero points and still managing to win. That's the kind of victory that makes you question everything you know about fantasy football.\n\nAs the great philosopher once said, \"In the game of zeros, everybody's a hero.\" I just made that up, but it feels right for this bizarre week. Until next time, this is SVP reminding you that sometimes the best fantasy strategy is just showing up - though this week, apparently, even that was optional. Back to you in the studio, where I assume the scoreboard is also broken.",
