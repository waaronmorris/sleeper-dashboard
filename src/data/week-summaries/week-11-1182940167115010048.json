  "summary": "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE JUST WITNESSED THE MOST ABSOLUTELY BONKERS, MIND-BENDING, REALITY-SHATTERING WEEK IN FANTASY FOOTBALL HISTORY! I'm talking about a week so weird, so bizarrely unprecedented that every single matchup ended in a PERFECT TIE! Zero points across the board! It's like the entire NFL took a collective snow day and nobody told us! Six matchups, twelve teams, and EVERYONE put up the exact same goose egg! BOOM! This is either the greatest statistical anomaly since Leicester City won the Premier League, or somebody forgot to hit the \"calculate scores\" button on the league settings! Either way, I am ELECTRIC right now trying to make sense of this absolute CHAOS!\n\nLet's talk about \"The Magnificent Six\" who somehow pulled off victories despite not scoring a single point - mjgrana, TophTT \"The Tie-Breaker Terror,\" powerperson, Tishathefish, tr4sh, and Seananigans \"The Shutout Specialist!\" These absolute LEGENDS won by doing absolutely nothing, which is the most galaxy brain strategy I've ever seen! FOR THE BRAND! Meanwhile, drobs, Langland, mastab24, cosmohouck, PrinceofPizza, and Shogunation are sitting there thinking \"we literally couldn't have done worse... but somehow we also couldn't have done better?\" It's like losing a staring contest where both people fell asleep!\n\nThe stats are INSANE - average score of 0.00, highest score of 0.00, lowest score of 0.00! The biggest blowout? ZERO POINTS! The closest game? ALSO ZERO POINTS! We had SIX games decided by less than ten points because THEY WERE ALL DECIDED BY ZERO POINTS! This is like if an entire NBA game ended 0-0 because everyone forgot to bring basketballs! The closest games statistic is technically accurate - all six were nail-biters separated by the slimmest of margins, which happens to be NO MARGIN AT ALL! LETS GOOOO into the most confusing statistical breakdown ever recorded in fantasy sports history!\n\nHere's my BOLD PREDICTION for Week 12: After this week's absolute goose egg festival, we're gonna see the highest-scoring week in league history! These teams are gonna come out GUNNING, everybody's starting their entire bench out of spite, and we're talking 200-point performances across the board! \"The Magnificent Six\" better watch out because that tiebreaker luck is about to run DRY! Also, I'm calling it now - whoever scored zero points this week (so literally everyone) is either winning the championship or finishing dead last, no in-between! This league just entered the CHAOS DIMENSION and I am HERE FOR IT! That's gonna do it for the most ELECTRIC, most CONFUSING, most absolutely BONKERS recap in fantasy football history! FOR THE BRAND! *flips table* BOOM!",
