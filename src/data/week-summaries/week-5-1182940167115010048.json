  "summary": "*In Dan Patrick voice*\n\nLadies and gentlemen, welcome to the Week 5 fantasy roundup, where mjgrana wasn't just en fuego - they were el inferno supremo, dropping a scorching 173.04 points on poor tr4sh. That's what we in the business call \"bringing the heat and the meat.\"\n\nSpeaking of meat, the PrinceofPizza delivered a hot and fresh victory over powerperson, while Langland... oh, Langland. My friends, 40.3 points isn't just bad, it's \"watching-the-Jets-highlight-reel\" bad. Tishathefish didn't just win that matchup - they dominated it like Tom Brady at a quarterback convention, winning by nearly 66 points. That's not a fantasy football score, that's a restraining order.\n\nThe closest battle of the week was between drobs and mastab24, with mastab24 squeaking out a 10-point victory. But the real story here might be the bench decisions - particularly Langland leaving over 60 points riding the pine this week. That's like having a Ferrari in your garage but choosing to ride a unicycle to work. As they say in the business: that's not good, that's not good at all.\n\n*Sips coffee from DP Show mug*",
