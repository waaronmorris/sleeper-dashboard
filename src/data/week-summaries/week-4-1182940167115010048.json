  "summary": "Oh baby, what a week we had in fantasy football! Like Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible, mastab24 pulled off what seemed absolutely impossible, dropping a whopping 149.68 points en route to the biggest blowout of the week. Poor Langland looked like they were stuck in the upside-down from Stranger Things, mustering just 73.60 points in what can only be described as a fantasy apocalypse.\n\nSpeaking of nail-biters, TophTT and tr4sh gave us more drama than the season finale of Succession, with TophTT squeaking out a 3.62-point victory. I haven't seen anything that close since my last haircut! And while PrinceofPizza delivered a royal beating to cosmohouck, Seananigans showed why they're the Sean of all trades, handling powerperson with a comfortable 29.84-point margin.\n\nBut folks, we need to talk about these bench decisions. It's like watching someone choose Betamax over VHS – and yes, I'm dating myself there. Mastab24 may have won big, but leaving 25.1 points on the bench? That's like having a Ferrari in your garage but taking the bus to work. And TophTT, those 20.5 points left on the bench could've come in handy in that photo finish! But hey, that's fantasy football for you – sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug, and sometimes you're the fantasy manager who overthinks their lineup like it's the final question on Jeopardy!",
